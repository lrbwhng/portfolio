  <h1>All About Me!</h1>
  <p>Hi! My name is Ellerbe Whang and I’m currently an incoming junior at Alameda Science and Technology Institute. I’ve lived in the Bay Area for almost 6 years, but I’ve also lived in San Diego, Las Vegas, and Berkeley. I’m a second generation Korean-American, and I love Korean culture, including the food and music.</p>
  <p>I like water sports like kayaking and I was a women’s coxswain on Oakland Strokes. I’ve won several awards for debate and public speaking, and created a debate club for middle schoolers in my community. During the summer into my sophomore year, I was an exclusive intern inside the Kanbar Simulation Center at UCSF. This summer, I’ve helped to create a volunteer program there and work as a volunteer coordinator. </p>
